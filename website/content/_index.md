# A Practical Guide to Python

### An immersive hands-on Python Course

Welcome to Practical Python! Practical Python is a one day intensive course designed for intermediate developers looking to get productive in reading and writing Python code as quickly as possible. 

This course was recorded for Frontend Masters by author Nina Zakharenko. Learn more about Nina [here](https://www.nnja.io/page/about/) or watch her other courses [here](http://nina.to/courses).

In this class, you'll learn all about conventions and best practices, the tricks of the trade, and what makes Python so special. By the end of the course, you'll be comfortable writing object-oriented Python.
