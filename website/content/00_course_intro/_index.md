# 100 Days Python Series

### What You'll Need to Know

This series is designed for advanced beginner to intermediate developers.

Ideally, you already have some programming experience and want to quickly build your skills in Python by diving into a variety of practical concepts and projects.

To get the most out of this series, you should be familiar with: 

- Basic command-line operations in any operating system.
- Programming experience in any language, with an understanding of concepts like variables, functions, and loops.
- A basic idea of APIs, including requests, responses, and HTTP status codes.

If you're completely new to programming or Python, consider starting with foundational resources to build your skills. Check out my content on Python basics and essentials in earlier videos or tutorials before diving into this series.

To fully participate in the series, ensure you have Python 3.10 or above installed and are using a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Follow the setup instructions provided in the next video.
