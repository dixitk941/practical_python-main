### Karan Dixit

{{< figure src="/images/karan-dixit.jpg?width=20pc" width="30%" title="Karan Dixit" >}}

Hi, I’m Karan Dixit.

I’m a passionate developer with expertise in full-stack development, AI integration, and a love for creating impactful projects. Over the years, I’ve built several innovative platforms, including **HiiHive**, a dynamic student-focused app, and **AINOR**, an AI-driven assistant. My journey in tech is fueled by my dedication to solving real-world problems with elegant solutions.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy guiding others in programming, working on creative design concepts, and continuously learning new technologies. I also actively document my development journey on platforms like Instagram and YouTube.

### Ongoing Projects
I am currently focusing on:
- **HiiHive**: Expanding its College Duniya feature to revolutionize how students interact with their campus.
- **AINOR**: Preparing for its launch with enhanced AI-driven tools for networking and resource aggregation.

### Upcoming Initiatives
I’m launching a **100-day React series** on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels to inspire budding developers to explore React.

Let’s build the future together—one project at a time!
